 AirBnB clone - Web static


Before developing a big and complex web application, I have to learn how to  build the front end step-by-step.


The first step is to "design" / "sketch" / "prototype" each element:

* Create ssmple HTML static pages
* Style guide
* Fake contents
* No Javascript
* No data loaded from anything.


During this project, I have learnt how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it is the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of my page, the design. I have to fix my  HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you cant apply any design.
